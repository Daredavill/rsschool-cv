#### Briefly About Myself
##### _I didn't think that my life would ever be connected with frontend development. From the moment I started studying at the university, I was looking for the first part-time jobs and these were retail sales. I have worked in various areas of retail sales as a salesperson. Later, my path led me to one of the largest companies, Inventive Retail Group, where I have been operating for ten years now. Since then, I have held the position of administrator and professionally work with Apple equipment and staff. I never stood still and tried to learn more: I have an Apple ACSP certificate, I received the Apple Expert status several times. And apparently my desire to learn new things led me to Frontend. Now I devote all my free time to studying Frontend Development._
